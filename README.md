DRAW 2 (which stands for **D**etect and **R**ecognize **A** **W**ide range of cards version 2) is an object detector
trained to detect _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ cards in all types of images, and in particular in dueling images.

Other works exist (see [Related Works](#div-aligncenterrelated-worksdiv)) but none is capable of recognizing cards during a duel.

DRAW 2 is entirely open source under AGPL 3.0 licence and all contributions are welcome.
